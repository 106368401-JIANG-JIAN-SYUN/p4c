<h2>Background</h2>
<p>In this section we give a brief overview of P4 and EBPF. A detailed treatment of these topics is outside the scope of this text.</p>
<h3>P4</h3>
<p>P4 (<a href="http://p4.org">http://p4.org</a>) is a domain-specific programming language for specifying the behavior of the dataplanes of network-forwarding elements. The name of the programming language comes from the title of a paper published in the proceedings of SIGCOMM Computer Communications Review in 2014: <a href="http://www.sigcomm.org/ccr/papers/2014/July/0000000.0000004:">http://www.sigcomm.org/ccr/papers/2014/July/0000000.0000004:</a> "Programming Protocol-Independent Packet Processors".</p>
<p>P4 itself is protocol-independent but allows programmers to express a rich set of data plane behaviors and protocols. This back-end only supports the newest version of the P4 programming language, <a href="http://p4.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/P4_16-prerelease-Dec_16.html">P4_16</a>. The core P4 abstractions are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Headers describe the format (the set of fields and their sizes) of each header within a packet.</li>
<li>Parser (finite-state machines) describe the permitted header sequences within received packets.</li>
<li>Tables associate keys to actions. P4 tables generalize traditional forwarding tables; they can be used to implement routing tables, flow lookup tables, access-control lists, etc.</li>
<li>Actions describe how packet header fields and metadata are manipulated.</li>
<li>Match-action units stitch together tables and actions, and perform the following sequence of operations:<ul>
<li>Construct lookup keys from packet fields or computed metadata,</li>
<li>Use the constructed lookup key to index into tables, choosing an action to execute,</li>
<li>Finally, execute the selected action.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Control flow is expressed as an imperative program describing the data-dependent packet processing within a pipeline, including the data-dependent sequence of match-action unit invocations.</li>
</ul>
<p>P4 programs describe the behavior of network-processing dataplanes. A P4 program is designed to operate in concert with a separate <em>control plane</em> program. The control plane is responsible for managing at runtime the contents of the P4 tables. P4 cannot be used to specify control-planes; however, a P4 program implicitly specifies the interface between the data-plane and the control-plane.</p>
<h3>EBPF</h3>
<h4>Safe code</h4>
<p>EBPF is a acronym that stands for Extended Berkeley Packet Filters. In essence EBPF is a low-level programming language (similar to machine code); EBPF programs are traditionally executed by a virtual machine that resides in the Linux kernel. EBPF programs can be inserted and removed from a live kernel using dynamic code instrumentation. The main feature of EBPF programs is their <em>static safety</em>: prior to execution all EBPF programs have to be validated as being safe, and unsafe programs cannot be executed. A safe program provably cannot compromise the machine it is running on:</p>
<ul>
<li>it can only access a restricted memory region (on the local stack)</li>
<li>it can run only for a limited amount of time; during execution it cannot block, sleep or take any locks</li>
<li>it cannot use any kernel resources with the exception of a limited set of kernel services which have been specifically whitelisted, including operations to manipulate tables (described below)</li>
</ul>
<h4>Kernel hooks</h4>
<p>EBPF programs are inserted into the kernel using <em>hooks</em>. There are several types of hooks available:</p>
<ul>
<li>any function entry point in the kernel can act as a hook; attaching an EBPF program to a function <code>foo()</code> will cause the EBPF program to execute every time some kernel thread executes <code>foo()</code>.</li>
<li>EBPF programs can also be attached using the Linux Traffic Control (TC) subsystem, in the network packet processing datapath. Such programs can be used as TC classifiers and actions.</li>
<li>EBPF programs can also be attached to sockets or network interfaces. In this case they can be used for processing packets that flow through the socket/interface.</li>
</ul>
<p>EBPF programs can be used for many purposes; the main use cases are dynamic tracing and monitoring, and packet processing. We are mostly interested in the latter use case in this document.</p>
<h4>EBPF Tables</h4>
<p>The EBPF runtime exposes a bi-directional kernel-userspace data communication channel, called <em>tables</em> (also called maps in some EBPF documents and code samples). EBPF tables are essentially key-value stores, where keys and values are arbitrary fixed-size bitstrings. The key width, value width and table size (maximum number of entries that can be stored) are declared statically, at table creation time.</p>
<p>In user-space tables handles are exposed as file descriptors. Both user- and kernel-space programs can manipulate tables, by inserting, deleting, looking up, modifying, and enumerating entries in a table.</p>
<p>In kernel space the keys and values are exposed as pointers to the raw underlying data stored in the table, whereas in user-space the pointers point to copies of the data.</p>
<h4>Concurrency</h4>
<p>An important aspect to understand related to EBPF is the execution model. An EBPF program is triggered by a kernel hook; multiple instances of the same kernel hook can be running simultaneously on different cores.</p>
<p>Each table however has a single instances across all the cores. A single table may be accessed simultaneously by multiple instances of the same EBPF program running as separate kernel threads on different cores. EBPF tables are native kernel objects, and access to the table contents is protected using the kernel RCU mechanism. This makes access to table entries safe under concurrent execution; for example, the memory associated to a value cannot be accidentally freed while an EBPF program holds a pointer to the respective value. However, accessing tables is prone to data races; since EBPF programs cannot use locks, some of these races often cannot be avoided.</p>
<p>EBPF and the associated tools are also under active development, and new capabilities are added frequently.</p>
<h2>Compiling P4 to EBPF</h2>
<p>From the above description it is apparent that the P4 and EBPF programming languages have different expressive powers. However, there is a significant overlap in their capabilities, in particular, in the domain of network packet processing. The following image illustrates the situation:</p>
<div class="image">
<img src="scope.png" alt="P4 and EBPF overlap in capabilities"/>
</div>
<p>We expect that the overlapping region will grow in size as both P4 and EBPF continue to mature.</p>
<p>The current version of the P4 to EBPF compiler translates programs written in the version P4_16 of the programming language to programs written in a restricted subset of C. The subset of C is chosen such that it should be compilable to EBPF using clang and/or bcc (the BPF Compiler Collection &ndash; <a href="https://github.com/iovisor/bcc">https://github.com/iovisor/bcc</a>).</p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line">         --------------              -------</div><div class="line">P4 ---&gt;  | P4-to-EBPF | ---&gt; C ----&gt; | BCC | --&gt; EBPF</div><div class="line">         --------------              -------</div></div><!-- fragment --><p>The P4 program only describes the packet processing <em>data plane</em>, that runs in the Linux kernel. The <em>control plane</em> must be separately implemented by the user. BCC tools simplify this task considerably, by generating C and/or Python APIs that expose the dataplane/control-plane APIs.</p>
<h3>Dependencies</h3>
<p>EBPF programs require a Linux kernel with version 4.2 or newer.</p>
<p>clang with an ebpf back-end.</p>
<h3>Supported capabilities</h3>
<p>The current version of the P4 to EBPF compiler supports a relatively narrow subset of the P4 language, but still powerful enough to write very complex packet filters and simple packet forwarding engines. We expect that the compiler's capabilities will improve gradually.</p>
<p>Here are some limitations imposed on the P4 programs:</p>
<ul>
<li>this architecture only supports packet filters: the control block returns a boolean value which indicates whether a packet is forwarded or dropped</li>
<li>arbitrary parsers can be compiled, but the BCC compiler will reject parsers that contain cycles</li>
<li>arithmetic on data wider than 32 bits is not supported</li>
<li>EBPF does not offer support for ternary or LPM tables</li>
</ul>
<h3>Translating P4 to C</h3>
<p>To simplify the translation, the P4 programmer should refrain using identifiers whose name starts with <code>ebpf_</code>.</p>
<p>The following table provides a brief summary of how each P4 construct is mapped to a corresponding C construct:</p>
<h4>Translating parsers</h4>
<table class="doxtable">
<tr>
<th>P4 Construct </th><th>C Translation  </th></tr>
<tr>
<td><code>header</code> </td><td><code>struct</code> type with an additional <code>valid</code> bit </td></tr>
<tr>
<td><code>struct</code> </td><td><code>struct</code> </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>parser state </td><td>code block </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>state transition </td><td><code>goto</code> statement </td></tr>
<tr>
<td><code>extract</code> </td><td>load/shift/mask data from packet buffer </td></tr>
</table>
<h4>Translating match-action pipelines</h4>
<table class="doxtable">
<tr>
<th>P4 Construct </th><th>C Translation  </th></tr>
<tr>
<td>table </td><td>2 EBPF tables: second one used just for the default action </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>table key </td><td><code>struct</code> type </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>table <code>actions</code> block </td><td>tagged <code>union</code> with all possible actions </td></tr>
<tr>
<td><code>action</code> arguments </td><td><code>struct</code> </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>table <code>reads</code> </td><td>EBPF table access </td></tr>
<tr>
<td><code>action</code> body </td><td>code block </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>table <code>apply</code> </td><td><code>switch</code> statement </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>counters </td><td>additional EBPF table </td></tr>
</table>
<h4>Using the generated code</h4>
<p>The resulting file contains the complete data structures, tables, and a C function named <code>ebpf_filter</code> that implements the P4-specified data-plane. This C file can be manipulated using clang or BCC tools; please refer to the BCC project documentation and sample test files of the P4 to EBPF source code for an in-depth understanding.</p>
<p>[TODO]</p>
<h5>Connecting the generated program with the TC</h5>
<p>The EBPF code that is generated is can be used as a classifier attached to the ingress packet path using the Linux TC subsystem. The same EBPF code should be attached to all interfaces. Note however that all EBPF code instances share a single set of tables, which are used to control the program behavior.</p>
